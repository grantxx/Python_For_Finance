    "# A practical introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you have probably heard of AI learning to play computer games on their own, a very popular example being Deepmind. Deepmind hit the news when their AlphaGo program defeated the South Korean Go world champion in 2016. There had been many successful attempts in the past to develop agents with the intent of playing Atari games like Breakout, Pong, and Space Invaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know what's common in most of these programs? A paradigm of Machine Learning known as **Reinforcement Learning**. For those of you that are new to RL, let's get some understand with few analogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning Analogy\n",
    "Consider the scenario of teaching a dog new tricks. The dog doesn't understand our language, so we can't tell him what to do. Instead, we follow a different strategy. We emulate a situation (or a cue), and the dog tries to respond in many different ways. If the dog's response is the desired one, we reward them with snacks. Now guess what, the next time the dog is exposed to the same situation, the dog executes a similar action with even more enthusiasm in expectation of more food. That's like learning \"what to do\" from positive experiences. Similarly, dogs will tend to learn what not to do when face with negative experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly how Reinforcement Learning works in a broader sense:\n",
    "- Your dog is an \"agent\" that is exposed to the **environment**. The environment could in your house, with you.\n",
    "- The situations they encounter are analogous to a **state**. An example of a state could be your dog standing and you use a specific word in a certain tone in your living room\n",
    "- Our agents react by performing an **action** to transition from one \"state\" to another \"state,\" your dog goes from standing to sitting, for example.\n",
    "- After the transition, they may receive a **reward** or **penalty** in return. You give them a treat! Or a \"No\" as a penalty.\n",
    "- The **policy** is the strategy of choosing an action given a state in expectation of better outcomes."

    "\n",
    "There are things that are easy to do for instant gratification, and there's things that provide long term rewards\n",
    "The goal is to not be greedy by looking for the quick immediate rewards, but instead to optimize for maximum rewards over the whole training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Sequence matters in Reinforcement Learning\n",

    "- The agent should receive a high positive reward for a successful dropoff because this behavior is highly desired\n",
    "- The agent should be penalized if it tries to drop off a passenger in wrong locations\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's assume Smartcab is the only vehicle in this parking lot. We can break up the parking lot into a 5x5 grid, which gives us 25 possible taxi locations. These 25 locations are one part of our state space. Notice the current location state of our taxi is coordinate (3, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also notice there are four (4) locations that we can pick up and drop off a passenger: R, G, Y, B or `[(0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,3)] ` in (row, col) coordinates. Our illustrated passenger is in location **Y** and they wish to go to location **R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we also account for one (1) additional passenger state of being inside the taxi, we can take all combinations of passenger locations and destination locations to come to a total number of states for our taxi environment; there's four (4) destinations and five (4 + 1)  passenger locations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our Taxi environment, we have the reward table, `P`, that the agent will learn from. It does thing by looking receiving a reward for taking an action in the current state, then updating a *Q-value* to remember if that action was beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values store in the Q-table are called a *Q-values*, and they map to a `(state, action)` combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-value for a particular state-action combination is representative of the \"quality\" of an action taken from that state. Better Q-values imply better chances of getting greater rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the taxi is faced with a state that includes a passenger at its current location, it is highly likely that the Q-value for `pickup` is higher when compared to other actions, like `dropoff` or `north`.\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\Large \\alpha$ (alpha) is the learning rate ($0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$) - Just like in supervised learning settings, $\\alpha$ is the extent to which our Q-values are being updated in every iteration.\n",
    "- $\\Large \\gamma$ (gamma) is the discount factor ($0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1$) - determines how much importance we want to give to future rewards. A high value for the discount factor (close to **1**) captures the long-term effective award, whereas, a discount factor of **0** makes our agent consider only immediate reward, hence making it greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this saying?**\n",
    "We are assigning ($\\leftarrow$), or updating, the Q-value of the agent's current *state* and *action* by first taking a weight ($1-\\alpha$) of the old Q-value, then adding the learned value. The learned value is a combination of the reward for taking the current action in the current state, and the discounted maximum reward from the next state we will be in once we take the current action.\n",

The reason for `reward/time_steps` is that we want to choose parameters which enable us to get the maximum reward as fast as possible. We may want to track the number of penalties corresponding to the hyperparameter value combination as well because this can also be a deciding factor (we don't want our smart agent to violate rules at the cost of reaching faster). A more fancy way to get the right combination of hyperparameter values would be to use Genetic Algorithms.\n",

    "## Conclusion and What's Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright! We began with understanding Reinforcement Learning with the help of real-world analogies. We then dived into the basics of Reinforcement Learning and framed a Self-driving cab as a Reinforcement Learning problem. We then used OpenAI's Gym in python to provide us with a related environment, where we can develop our agent and evaluate it. Then we observed how terrible our agent was without using any algorithm to play the game, so we went ahead to implement the Q-learning algorithm from scratch. The agent's performance improved significantly after Q-learning. Finally, we discussed better approaches for deciding the hyperparameters for our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning is one of the easiest Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The problem with Q-earning however is, once the number of states in the environment are very high, it becomes difficult to implement them with Q table as the size would become very, very large. State of the art techniques uses Deep neural networks instead of the Q-table (Deep Reinforcement Learning). The neural network takes in state information and actions to the input layer and learns to output the right action over the time. Deep learning techniques (like Convolutional Neural Networks) are also used to interpret the pixels on the screen and extract information out of the game (like scores), and then letting the agent control the game.\n",

    "We have discussed a lot about Reinforcement Learning and games. But Reinforcement learning is not just limited to games. It is used for managing stock portfolios and finances, for making humanoid robots, for manufacturing and inventory management, to develop general AI agents, which are agents that can perform multiple things with a single algorithm, like  the same agent playing multiple Atari games. Open AI also has a platform called universe for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across myriads of games, websites and other general applications."
